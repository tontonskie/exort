# Exort Framework

## Introduction

Exort is just another TypeScript framework that supports dependency injection on top of expressjs. I personally built this framework base on my preferences with some inspiration from other frameworks such as NestJS and Laravel. This framework utilizes decorators and reflection for most of its features and doesn't enforce any folder structure. So let's get started.

## Installation

```
npm install -g @exort/cli
```
